## Compile the Shell Program: 
- Open your terminal and navigate to the directory where your shell program (myshell.c) is located. Then, compile the program using a C compiler, such as gcc. Here's the command to compile the program:
            gcc -o myshell myshell.c

This command tells gcc to compile myshell.c and generate an executable file named myshell.

## Run the Shell: Once the compilation is successful, you can run your shell by executing the generated executable:
            ./myshell

This command runs the myshell executable, which is your simple shell program.

Use the Shell: After running the shell, you should see a command prompt where you can enter commands. Your shell should read user input, parse the commands, and execute them as specified in your shell program.

Interact with the Shell: You can enter various commands just like you would in a regular terminal. Your shell program should execute the commands and provide output as specified in your code.

### Exit the Shell: To exit the shell, you can typically type the exit command or use the Ctrl+C keyboard shortcut to terminate the shell program.
